# API Testing Approach

I approach API testing by focusing on how APIs are consumed by both web and mobile applications.

Key considerations:
- APIs must be reliable as they serve multiple platforms
- Proper error handling is crucial for frontend stability
- Authorization and validation must be consistent
- Regression testing helps prevent breaking changes

This approach ensures APIs can support scalable and maintainable products.
